+  What is this?	 

  This is a wrapper for getting weather information from Yahoo Weather API, for android.

+ How do I use it? 
	
   * First, implement YahooWeatherInfoListener in your Activity. Overwrite the callback function "gotWeatherInfo", which will be called after querying from Yahoo weather API.
	
	```java
	@Override
	public void gotWeatherInfo(WeatherInfo weathe{
		if(weatherInfo != null) {
			// Add your code here
		}
	}
	```

  * Second, use following code to assign the location where you want to get weather information at. Or you can input the location in app's top search bar.
	
	```java
	private String location = "Tokyo Japan";
	```

    Replace "Name of City or Area" to what you want. For example, "Tokyo Japan", "Acara√π Brazil", "Shanghai China", etc.


+ What kind of weather information can I get?	
  You can get 
  * current condition of weather, humidity, wind, etc.
  * forecast information for next two days.
