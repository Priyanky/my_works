                    <p>An Activity Object is one of the building blocks of an Android application. An Activity provides the application with context to render to the screen. An Android application typically has at least one Activity object.</p>

                    <p>When query results are returned by Gracenote they can contain Link data which directly pertains to the result it is embedded in. A single piece of Link data consists of an identifier (Integer) and a source (String). The source is the provider of the identifier, such as Amazon.com. The identifier is a unique key into the providers catalog which can be used to present the user with additional content or services. A single result can contain multiple pieces of Link data from multiple providers.</p>

                <td>
                    <p>Pulse Coded Modulation is the process of converting an analog in a sequence of digital numbers. The accuracy of conversion is directly affected by the sampling frequency and the bit-depth. The sampling frequency defines how often the current level of the audio signal is read and converted to a digital number. The bit-depth defines the size of the digital number. The higher the frequency and bit-depth, the more accurate the conversion.</p>

                    <p>Mobile Client defines Java interfaces that allow Mobile Client operations to deliver results to the application. These interfaces are known as Result Ready Interfaces.</p>

                <td>
                    <p>An object that implements a Result Ready Interface is a Result Ready Object. An instance of a Result Ready Object must be provided when invoking a Mobile Client operation, so the operation can deliver results to the application.</p>

                    <p>Certain audio recognition products provided by Mobile Client return a single result: the single best match. The single best match is determined by Web Services based on criteria specific to the application. This criteria can be refined by the application.</p>
